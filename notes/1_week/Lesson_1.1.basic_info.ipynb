This is useful for trying out small code snippets or testing out functions before using them in a larger program. In the interactive window, you can type a Python command, press Enter, and see the output immediately. For example, if you type 3 + 6 in the interactive window, you will see the output 9 immediately."

For example, you can write a Python program that reads data from a file, processes the data, and then writes the results to a new file."
